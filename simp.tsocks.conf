# This is the configuration for libtsocks (transparent socks)
# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored
#
# The basic idea is to specify:
#	- Local subnets - Networks that can be accessed directly without
#			  assistance from a socks server
#	- Paths - Paths are basically lists of networks and a socks server
#		  which can be used to reach these networks
#	- Default server - A socks server which should be used to access 
#			   networks for which no path is available
# Much more documentation than provided in these comments can be found in
# the man pages, tsocks(8) and tsocks.conf(8)

# Local networks
# For this example this machine can directly access 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 
# (192.168.0.*) and 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 (10.*)
